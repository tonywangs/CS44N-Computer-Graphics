# Sparkly Spirals
This project showcases a colorful and interactive spiral pattern using the p5.js library. The animation creates a grid of concentric circles that change colors dynamically and adjust their position based on the mouse location. I wanted to create something grungy and assertive.  

Features  
Dynamic Background: The background color is set to a bright, sunny hue.  
Interactive Grid: The grid of spirals adjusts based on the mouse position.  
Random Colors: Each circle within the spirals is colored randomly for a sparkly effect.
