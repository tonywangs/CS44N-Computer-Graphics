# Colorful Observable Universe
This project showcases a colorful and interactive particle animation using the p5.js library. The animation creates a grid of particles that move based on Perlin noise and react to the mouse position. The background color changes dynamically to create a vibrant, rainbow-like effect. The intention was to emulate the observable universe, demonstrating how chaos and randomness naturally lends itself to certain universal patterns.

Features  
Dynamic Background: The background color cycles through the hues of the rainbow.  
Interactive Particles: Particles move based on Perlin noise and change behavior when the mouse is near.  
Reset Functionality: Clicking the mouse resets the particle grid.
