# Inverted Drops
This project demonstrates an interactive particle system using the p5.js library. Particles are created as the user drags the mouse, and they move upward, giving the effect of inverted drops. Each particle is colored randomly and disappears when it reaches the top of the canvas.  

Features  
- Interactive Particle Creation: Particles are created by dragging the mouse across the canvas.  
- Random Colors: Each particle is assigned a random color.  
- Upward Movement: Particles move upward, simulating an inverted drop effect.  
- Automatic Cleanup: Particles are removed from the array once they move off the screen.
